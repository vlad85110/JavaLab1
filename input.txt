When writing programs, a programmer almost always uses
high-level programming languages. As a result of work
programmer, the source code of the program is created, which is stored in
one or more text files. In order for the resulting
the program could be executed on a computer, it was necessary
convert from original high-level language representation to
binary representation containing commands that can be executed
central processing unit of the computer. This transformation is done with
using programs called compilers. Receiving one or
several files with the source code of the program, the compiler creates
binary representation and saves it to binary executables,
which can be loaded by the main control program of the computer
(operating system) and run on the computer.
